Welcome to my first post. I long thought of the idea of writing blogs or diary on my webiste, but was either too buzy with other tasks or not motivated enough to begin. But look where I am now. This is also a perfect timing for me, as I just wrapped up my first year of Master. Over the past year, a lot of thing happened: finally entered grad school, TA experience, and getting my first internship offer.

Practically speaking, grad school isn't much different from college, at least academically. I still take classes, follow the same schedule, and prepare for exams. However, I did start working out more under the influence of my roommates. Before, I only played badminton with my friends during the weekend, which was also my primary source of exercise. However, starting around mid-September, I began to go to the gym with my roommates and slowly ramped up the intensity. Now, it has become one of my weekly routines, where I won't skip even during the final week.

In addition, I was fortunate to receive a TA offer during winter break. It was fully because I got the email from Prof. Paul a few days after the departmental rejection email. It's a pleasant surprise that I won't complain. I've always wanted to become a teaching assistant, not only because of the various benefits, but also the idea of challenging myself. I want to further improve my communication skills and the ability to confidently explain the materials to others. As for the workload, it wasn't too much of a burden. I'm glad to be surrounded by other great TAs and the professor. If everything goes according to plan, I'll also be TAing another course in the next semester.

Lastly, it's about my journey in the internship hunt. Dating back to the beginning of last semester, when I started my annual summer internship hunt, I had the pressure that was not like before. Since this will be my last summer before graduation, getting an internship is essential to my future full-time job search. As time went by, I went through the first round of interviews for some companies, but I had no luck scoring the final run. Although I didn't seem to be bothered, I can feel the pressure is building up as I watched my friends land their internships both in the U.S. and Taiwan.

My application spree slowed down around March, when the new job posts started to decline. It was not until early May that I started getting another round of interviews from different companies I applied to in late April. This also coincided with my final projects, leading to my busiest weeks. Thankfully, I was able to navigate through the tasks, and the semester was about to come to an end. Then on Tuesday afternoon, when I started to pack up for my flight tomorrow, I got an offer. I'm kinda shocked at first and could not believe what I just saw. It took me a while to process all the information as the news came all of a sudden.

Fast forward to now, where I'm back home sitting in front of my desk writing this blog, I'm still excited about the news. I look forward to all the experiences and challenges I will face during this summer.

Before wrapping up this post, I guess the moral of the story is to never give up - there's always a chance, and if you never lose hope, everything is possible.
